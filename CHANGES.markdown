## v0.6.4

Minor improvements:
* The `stubView` for stubbing pages when testing controllers now
  provides more direct access to the last render view message.

Bugs fixed:
* [Issue #28][i28]: Support Linux for creating projects and running
  the build.
* [Issue #35][i35]: Allow app specific environment keys.
* [Issue #31][i31]: Working with image assets will break the
  web:apache:start task. Now creates the `images` output directory as
  required.
* [Issue #26][i26]: Empty JS strings passed to JS functions are not
  escaped properly.
* [iOS Issue #3][ios-i3]: Prevent app from crashing when invoking
  plugin callback.
* [Issue #34][i34]: [web] Custom headers are not propagated to the
  ajax request.
* [Issue #32][i32]: calatrava.bridge.request() seems to require an
  optional "body" under iOS. One of `contentType` or `customHeaders`
  was also required, this too has been fixed.
* [Issue #39][i39]: [ios] Network activity spinner
* [Issue #40][i40]: calatrava.bridge.request() seems to require a
  "failure" callback in the browser, although documented as "optional"
* [Issue #42][i42]: Fixes the MobileWeb app loading issue. Pages were
  hidden by default, but the `show` and `hide` implementations for the
  converter page were incomplete.

## v0.6.3

Bugs fixed:
* [Issue #22][i22] and [Issue #23][i23]: Support `*.scss` files as
  well as `*.sass` files.
* [Issue #24][i24]: Create the stylesheet output directories as part
  of the build process.
* [Issue #25][i25]: Recreate the `load_file.txt` when the feature
  manifest changes.
* iOS was correctly dispatching timer firings back to the controller
  code.

## v0.6.2

* Moving to a more recent version of the `xcodeproj` gem caused a
  conflict with Frank that needed to be resolved.

## v0.6.1

* iOS was not correctly loading HTML UIs. Fixing this also required
  re-working the project creation.

## v0.6.0

* Added
[plugin support](https://github.com/calatrava/calatrava/wiki/Plugins)
* Added an alert plugin implementation:
  `web/app/source/alert.web.coffee`,
  `droid/test/src/com/calatrava/bridge/AlertPlugin.java` and
  `ios/Pods/calatrava/calatrava-ios/Bridge/AlertPlugin.m`.
* Substantial re-writing of the build tasks. Should largely not be
  externally visible, except there are a lot less tasks now.
  
Bugs fixed:
* [Issue #5][i5]: Creates the droid build with default name of the
  project as 'test' instead of the project name
* [Issue #12][i12]: Failing AJAX - Typo in calatrava.inbound
* [Issue #13][i13]: Problem Building on Xcode (4.5.1) - Can't Find
  Bundler
* [Issue #14][i14]: Cosmetic: ios/public misplaced during calatrava
  create
* [Issue #15][i15]: Uncaught TypeError: Object #&lt;Object&gt; has no
  method 'success'
  
Changes that will affect existing projects:
* Edited httpd conf template: `config/templates/httpd.conf.erb`
* Edited the single page Haml template: `web/app/views/index.haml`

## v0.5.0

* First public release
